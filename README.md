# Indentation-Fixer
A python script to fix the indentation issues in other languages. 
It is initially developed to fix php codes. 
But it should also work for other languages like C, C++, C#, where brackets (“{“, “}”) are used to increase and decrease indentation levels. 
So it cannot be used for fixing python codes.
